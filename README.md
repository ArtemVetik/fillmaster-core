### About

This project is a concept for a pure C# game completely isolated from the game engine.
The `Core` folder contains game logic in C#. `UnityLibrary` folder contains implementation of views, input and infrastructure necessary to run the game. `UnityLibrary` does not contain any significant game logic.
